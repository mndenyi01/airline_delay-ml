    "1. Decide on final dataframe columns to be used for modelling- more like which features do you know before departure. i.e Feature Enriched dataset.\n",
    "- ✔️Derived information from existing columns to give birth to more informative columns, making EDA eaiser and better.\n",
    "2. Decide on columns to be used to get the most insights out of EDA.\n",
    "- Decision based notebook with minimal code.\n",
    "- Column related questions are discussed with final verdict.\n",
    "3. A complete and saved dataset for the second phase of Feature engineering.\n",
    "- Correct model mental visualisation"
